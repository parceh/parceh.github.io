I created this website so you can know me better. In [About/CV](/about-cv) you will find some information about my background, work, and professional interests. In [Resources](/resources) you will find different scripts and documents for data analysis that I have created either for my previous jobs or for practicing my skills. In [Posts](/posts)  you can find links to podcasts, articles, and other interesting and fun external sources. 

This website is designed to be public, so please feel comfortable using any resource that you find useful for your own work. 
Thatâ€™s all! Feel free to explore my website. If you want to contact me, you can do it to parcehasbun@gmail.com!
