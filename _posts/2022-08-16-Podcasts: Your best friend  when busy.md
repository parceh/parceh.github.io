If you, like me, love to stay informed about international news and find X (ex-Twitter) a little bit too much (for your mental health), then you might want to listen to some of these podcasts:

- **Pod Save the world**: Excellent podcast about US foreign policy. Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes are hilarious. 

- **The Daily from the New York Times**: Who doesn't listen to the Daily? 30-minute story with a new relevant topic every morning.   
 
- **Global News Podcast - From BBC**: Great summary of news and one of the few podcasts that frequently feature news from Africa and Asia.
 
- **The Ezra Klein Show**: In-depth interviews about a hot topics. Also from The New York Times. 
 
- **EU Confidential - Politico**: weekly 30-minute podcast with Europe news. 
 
- **Today Explained**: Eclectic variety of topics to detangle in 30 minutes.

  I find them super usefull  for a quick update.
