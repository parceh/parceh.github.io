If you, like me, love to stay informed about international news and find Twitter a bit too much (for your mental health), then you might want to listen to some of these podcasts:

- **Pods Save the world**: Excellent podcast about US foreign policy. Tom Vietor and Ben Rhodes are hilarious. 
- **The Daily from the New York Times**: Who doesn't listen to the Daily? 30-minute story with a relevant topic of the week.   
- **Global News Podcast**: Great summary of news and one of the few podcasts that frequently feature news from Africa and Asia.
- **The Ezra Klein Show**: In-depth interviews about a hot topic. Also from The New York Times. 
- **EU Confidential - Politico**: weekly 30 minutes podcast with Europe News. 
- **Today Explained**: Eclectic variety of topics to detangle in 30 minutes.
