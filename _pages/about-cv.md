## Experience
I'm a Master (M.Sc.) in Economics at the University of Amsterdam.

I enjoy working in the area of governmental and private advisory on topics related to health, employment, and other policies. 
## Skills
Over the years, I've applied my statistics and economics knowledge in the data analysis of:
- **Financial and economic indexes** published in specialized newspapers in Chile, aiming at providing inputs for private decision-making. 
- **Policy briefs** related to health and employment policies that aim to inform policymakers and the general public.
- **Program evaluations** aiming to evaluate the impact of auditing health institutions in developing countries.
- **Academic research** on diverse topics such as employment dynamics, the economic consequences of infancy-related decisions, and the nature versus nurture determinants of health and economic outcomes.

Also, I'm proficient in software for data analysis such as Stata, R, and Python.  
FYI: I'm fluent in English and Spanish.
