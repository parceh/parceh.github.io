# About me

I'm a Master in Economics at the University of Amsterdam. I've worked as a Researcher in Private and Public institutions at University linked economic research centers, ministries, and consulting firms in Latin America and Europe such as Universidad del Desarrollo, Ministry of Social Development, and the University of Zurich.

I enjoy working in the area of governmental advisory and public policy on topics related to health, inequality, and labor policy.
